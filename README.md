This was the first project in my CS-210 course on C++ coding. I coded a program that allows international users to access both a 12-hour and 24-hour clock. Users have the option to enter a specific time into the program to get the 12-hour and 24-hour clock display of the time of their choice. This program's requirements consisted of challenging formatting guidelines and effectively implementing input validation. I also am proud of how well the formatted menu came out, with all the asteriks forming a visually aesthetic display. The learned skills from this project will be helpful in future programming endeavors. Making the program maintainable, readable, and adapatable involved mapping out my ideas prior, and sectioning my code to prevent confusion. Thank you for reading!
