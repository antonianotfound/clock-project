This was the first project in my CS-210 course on C++ coding. I coded a program that allows international users to access both a 12-hour and 24-hour clock. Users have the option to enter a specific time into the program to get the 12-hour and 24-hour clock display of the time of their choice. The reason why I chose this program is because I am proud of how effectively I finished this project. I followed all formatting guidelines, including putting the main function last as was required and including validation. I also am proud of how well the formatted menu came out, with all the asteriks making a fancy display. The learned skills from this project will be helpful in future projects, such as use of white-space, formatting my program output, and formatting my code. These are all integral for writing effective, clean code. Making the program maintainable, readable, and adapatable involved mapping out my ideas prior, and sectioning my code to prevent confusion. Thank you for reading!
